**Machina Learning**

A simple example of Classification and Regression problem.
Using data on UCI. 

Everything is like what we learned these years.
But notice the usage of 'pipeline', 'GridSearchCV', 'cross_val_score', 'dataframe.hist&plot', 'matshow', 'scatter_matrix', 'boxplot'.

Here are the links:

# Project_Training_1
**Web Crawler**

In this section, we have 3 examples of web crawler.

The first one uses 'request' and 'BeautifulSoup' to get and pick the data. Searching with a tree structure is efficient.

The second one uses 'request' and 're'. But we need to think out the regular expression by looking at the Html code.
Besides, TianMao has its own way to defense. I wanted data of all pages at first but I only got one page at last.

The third one uses 'selenium' to create a 'chromedriver'. It sounds great but actually costs me a lot of time. Because Google Colaboratory can't get the correct
 permission.(you have to use absolute path) Maybe I can solve this problem one day.
